# RustGuessingGame
## Overview
This is a console based guessing game written in Rust, with the objective of guessing a number between 1 and 100 inclusive. This is a completed version of the Guessing Game exercise featured in the Rust Book ([viewable here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html)).
## File locations
The source code can be found at the location guessing_game/src.

Ececutable files can be found in these locations:
- guessing_game\target\debug
- guessing_game\target\release

To compile the program, navigate to the guessing_game folder in a terminal and type one of the following commands (this only works if Rust is installed on your device):

`cargo build` (builds to debug folder)
`cargo build --release` (builds to release folder)

## How to play
To make a guess, type a number into the console and press enter. If the number inputted matches the one generated by the program at launch, the game will end. Otherwise, the console will print whether the number is too high or low and you will be prompted to enter another number.
## Notes
When running the game on a terminal, the window will automatically close when the correct answer is given (the console will print "You win!" before this happens). As of the time of me pushing this program, there is no means to keep the terminal open after the game is won.
